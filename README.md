## ⚙️ Key Concepts & Challenges
1. **Sentiment Analysis** – determine sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral)  
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – preprocessing, tokenization, stopword removal, TF-IDF  
3. **Machine Learning Algorithms** – Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Deep Learning  
4. **Feature Engineering** – extracting meaningful features from text data  
5. **Data Visualization** – presenting results with charts & word clouds
